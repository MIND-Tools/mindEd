The MindEd Graphical Editor (or Diagram Editor) provides a graphical representation of adl files.<br/>
It also supplies various features for edition.<br /><br />

<strong>Features</strong>
<ul>
	<li> <span class="def"> Palette </span> <br />
	The palette provides creation tools for all items, in the form of a paint-like application.
	</li>
	<br />
	<li> <span class="def"> Properties view </span> <br />
	The properties view display the attributes' values of the selected item (e.g. name). These can be modified
	if not greyed out. To show this view, clic on an element and select "Show properties view".
	</li>
	<br />
	<li> <span class="def"> Labels </span> <br />
	Names or values are displayed in the editor, and can be directly edited.
	</li>
	<br />
	<li> <span class="def"> Serialization </span> <br />
	Created or modified items are serialized, meaning that the appropriate code will be generated in the adl file.

	</li>
	<br />
	<li> <span class="def"> Validation </span> <br />
	If you make a mistake when you are editing an adl file, a warning (or an error) is 
	displayed inside the Eclipse problem view and directly into the editor. When you put the cursor 
	on it, a message describes the error more precisely.<br/>
	Some problems will keep you from saving in order not to generate incoherent code.
	</li>
	<br /> 
	<li> <span class="def"> Links to other definitions </span> <br />
	When other files are referenced by a label, double clic on it to open the file in a new tab.<br/>
	This feature includes :
	- adl files (e.g. extends or conformsto)<br/>
	- cpl files (e.g. source or data)<br/>
	- itf files (e.g. provides or requires)
	</li>
	<br /> 
	<li> <span class="def"> Sub Components </span> <br />
	Sub components switch from composite/primitive and anonymous/inherited depending on their contents.<br/>
	To change the kind, either change the reference or delete the body to create a new one.
	</li>
	<br /> 
	<li> <span class="def"> Opening </span> <br />
	To open a definition in the graphical editor :<br/>
	- In Mind View, right clic > Open With > MindEd Graphical Editor
